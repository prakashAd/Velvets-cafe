            Question1:How to Setup My New Macbook pro?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6" color="dark">
            Answer:The first time your MacBook Pro starts up, Setup Assistant
            walks you through the simple steps needed to start using your new
            Mac. You can respond to all the prompts, or skip some steps and
            choose to complete them later. For example, it might make sense to
            set up Screen Time—which you can set for different users—after
            initial setup.
